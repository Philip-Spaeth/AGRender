# AGRender

**AGRender** is a high-performance rendering engine for visualizing results from N-body simulations, specifically designed to produce photorealistic imagery of galactic structures and astrophysical phenomena. It leverages modern **OpenGL** techniques and custom **GLSL shaders** to render millions of particles in real-time, using scientifically meaningful color maps and physically-inspired lighting models.

This tool enables researchers and enthusiasts to explore and present cosmic-scale simulations with both scientific accuracy and cinematic visual fidelity.

## üîß Technical Overview

AGRender is built on a C++ backend using **OpenGL 4.5+**, taking full advantage of GPU acceleration for rendering dense particle datasets. Key rendering techniques include:

- **Deferred shading pipeline** for high-performance lighting effects
- **Physically-based particle luminance calculation**, driven by stellar and gas components
- **Custom GLSL fragment and vertex shaders** to control point sprite rendering, blending, and coloring
- **Efficient camera control system** for both real-time navigation and scripted flythroughs
- Support for **high dynamic range (HDR)** rendering and tone mapping
- Optimized data transfer via **Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)** and **Uniform Buffer Objects (UBOs)**
